# <Agent Name>

## Purpose

Describe the commitment or policy this agent is designed to serve.

## Files

- `agent.js`: agent-specific logic and decision flow.
- `commitment.txt`: plain-language commitment/rules.
- `agent.json`: metadata (if applicable).

## Locality Rule

Agent-specific behavior for this module must stay in this directory. Do not move single-agent logic into shared generalized files in `agent/src/lib/` or `agent/src/index.js`.

## Validation

- `<module-specific test command>`
- `<simulation command>`
