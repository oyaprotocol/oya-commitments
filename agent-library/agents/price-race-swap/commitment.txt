Use any available USDC balance currently held by the commitment Safe at the time of execution.

Monitor two trigger conditions and execute exactly one branch:

1) ETH branch
- If ETH/USDC >= 3200 first, buy ETH with all available USDC.
- Execute on Uniswap.
- If a specific pool is configured, use that pool; otherwise use a high-liquidity Uniswap pool.

2) UMA branch
- If UMA/USDC <= 2.10 first, buy UMA with all available USDC.
- Execute on Uniswap.
- If a specific pool is configured, use that pool; otherwise use a high-liquidity Uniswap pool.

Global rules:
- First trigger wins.
- Execute at most one swap total for this commitment.
- If both triggers become true in the same evaluation cycle, prefer ETH branch.
- Enforce max slippage of 0.50%.
- If no valid route satisfies slippage and liquidity constraints, do not trade.
