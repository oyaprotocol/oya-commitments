Limit Order Rules (SMA-based): Purchase WETH when ETH price is at or below the 200-day Simple Moving Average.

When ethPriceUSD (CoinGecko) is less than or equal to smaEth200USD (200-day SMA from CoinGecko), propose a swap of 1 USDC ($1 = 1000000 micro-USDC) for WETH using this Safe's funds.
The Safe must be pre-funded with sufficient USDC. Swap output (WETH) goes to this Safe.
Token addresses: WETH 0x7b79995e5f793A07Bc00c21412e50Ecae098E7f9, USDC 0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238.
Only execute one swap. Max slippage 0.50%.
